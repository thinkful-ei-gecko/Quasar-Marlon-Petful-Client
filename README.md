## Petful
Sign up to adopt a pet on a first-come, first-served basis. When it's your time to choose, you can choose to adopt only the dog and/or cat that's at the top of the queue. 

Users can access the adopted page and submit their name to a person queue. If there are available pets, they will be allowed to select from pets at the top of the queue.  Users will be able to scroll through other pets waiting to be adopted, as well as past pets that have already been adopted.
